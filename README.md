**C$50 Finance** is a web application that allows you to manage stock portfolios. This tool allows you to check actual current stock prices and investment portfolio values, as well as buy and sell (ok, "buy and sell") stocks by querying [IEX](https://www.iexexchange.io/products/market-data-connectivity) for stock prices.
Indeed, IEX allows you to download stock quotes using its own API.
